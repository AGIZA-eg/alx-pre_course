## 1) What is an API?

# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

An Application Programming Interface (API) acts as a bridge between different software components, enabling them to interact and communicate with each other. APIs are an essential part of modern software development, defining rules and methods for accessing specific services or data from a service, library, or system.

## Versatile utility

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) find common use in programming applications for various purposes:

- **Data Retrieval:** APIs allow applications to retrieve data from remote servers, databases, or online services. This data can range from real-time weather information to user profiles and beyond.
- **Submitting Data:** APIs provide a way for applications to send data to a server, facilitating actions such as form submissions, online payments, or updating stored information.

## Presence everywhere

APIs are available everywhere in different fields, including:

- **Mobile Application Development:** Mobile applications typically use APIs to retrieve data from servers, access device features, and integrate with other applications and services.
- **Desktop Applications:** Even desktop programs make use of APIs, allowing connection to web services, databases, and peripheral devices.
- **Web Development:** APIs are prevalent in web development, enabling seamless interactions between web applications and servers, as well as enhancing third-party integrations.

In today's software development landscape, APIs are not just optional but integral and indispensable components. It enables developers to create innovative solutions by harnessing the capabilities of other software components and services. Application programming interfaces (APIs) open the door to improved efficiency, expanded functionality, and seamless integration between diverse technologies.

## 2) Architectural styles for APIs

- when using APIs in your project you will show what is the suitable architectural style for this project
- In this blog we study several architectural styles for communication in distributed systems. The REST style (Representational State Transfer), the REST-like style, the RPC style (Remote Procedure Call), the SOAP style and GraphQL. We compare the approaches, show advantages and disadvantages, commonalities and differences.

### 1- **REST Style**

- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for services, and as such it defines a set of architectural constraints and agreements. A service, which complies with the REST constraints, is said to be RESTful.
- REST is designed to make optimal use of an HTTP-based infrastructure and due to the success of the web, HTTP-based infrastructure, such as servers, caches and proxies, are widely available. The web, which is based on HTTP, provides some proof for an architecture that not only scales extremely well but also has longevity. The basic idea of REST is to transfer the ideas that worked well for the web and apply them to web services.
- HATEOAS is an abbreviation for Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State. HATEOAS is the aspect of REST, which allows for dynamic architectures. It allows clients to explore any API without any a-priori knowledge of data formats or of the API itself.

### 2- **RPC Style**

- RPC is an abbreviation for Remote Procedure Call. RPC is an architectural style for distributed systems. It has been around since the 1980s. Today the most widely used RPC styles are JSON-RPC and XML-RPC. Even SOAP can be considered to follow an RPC architectural style.
- The central concept in RPC is the procedure. The procedures do not need to run on the local machine, but they can run on a remote machine within the distributed system. When using an RPC framework, calling a remote procedure should be as simple as calling a local procedure.

### 3- **SOAP Style**

- SOAP follows the RPC style (see previous section) and exposes procedures as central concepts (e.g. getCustomer). It is standardized by the W3C and is the most widely used protocol for web services. SOAP style architectures are in widespread use, however, typically only for company internal use or for services called by trusted partners.

### 4- **GraphQL Style**

- For a long time, REST was thought to be the only appropriate tool for building modern APIs. But in recent years, another tool was added to the toolbox, when Facebook published GraphQL, the philosophy, and framework powering its popular API. More and more tech companies tried GraphQL and adopted it as one of their philosophies for API design. Some built a GraphQL API next to their existing REST API, some replaced their REST API with GraphQL, and even others have ignored the GraphQL trend to focus single-mindedly on their REST API.
- But, not only the tech companies are divided. Following the discussions around REST and GraphQL, there seem to be two camps of gurus leading very emotional discussions: “always use the hammer,” one camp proclaims. *“*NO*, always use the screwdriver,”* the other camp insists. And for the rest of us? Unfortunately, this situation is confusing, leading to paralysis and indecision about API design.
- The intention of the Book on REST & GraphQL is to clear up the confusion and enable you to make your own decision, the decision that is right for your API. By having the necessary criteria for comparison and general properties, strengths, and weaknesses of the approach, you can choose if the hammer or the screwdriver is better suited for your API project.

## 3) Why is REST API so popular?

## Defining REST and API

let's establish clear definitions for the terms REST, API, and RESTful:

**API (Application Programming Interface):** An API is a set of definitions and protocols designed for building and integrating application software. In simple terms, it's the language that allows you to communicate with a computer or system, making requests for information or actions.

**REST (Representational State Transfer):** REST is an architectural style that provides standards for interactions between computer systems over the web. It simplifies system-to-system communication.

**RESTful:** When web services adhere to the REST architectural style, they are termed RESTful web services.

A RESTful system consists of two essential components:

1. A client that requests resources.
2. A server that holds and provides those resources.

## Architectural Constraints of RESTful API

RESTful APIs adhere to six architectural constraints:

1. **Uniform Interface:** The interface is consistent and straightforward.
2. **Stateless:** Each request is independent, and the server doesn't store client information.
3. **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached, enhancing speed and efficiency.
4. **Client-Server:** A clear separation between client and server allows independent development.
5. **Layered System:** Multiple layers can be used to handle requests, improving scalability and security.
6. **Code on Demand:** Code can be delivered and executed on the client, enhancing functionality.

## Why REST API is Popular

Now, let's delve into why REST APIs are so popular  Here are the key benefits, along with concise explanations:

1. **Easy to Understand and Implement:**
    - REST uses familiar HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
    - It follows a client-server architecture, allowing developers to work independently on both ends.
    - This simplicity makes it easy to grasp and implement in your projects.
2. **Scalability:**
    - Stateless nature: The server doesn't store client information, enabling it to handle any client request independently.
    - This statelessness enables the deployment of APIs to multiple servers, accommodating many concurrent requests.
3. **Cacheable:**
    - Caching for quicker responses is simplified by REST.
    - GET and POST requests can be easily cached using Cache-Control and Expires headers.
4. **Flexibility and Portability:**
    - REST allows for easy updates to database data.
    - It supports different data types (XML, JSON, etc.), catering to diverse client requests.
    - REST simplifies resource management, reducing application complexity.

REST APIs have become an integral part of software development due to their simplicity, scalability, catchability, and flexibility. They empower developers to build interconnected, feature-rich applications with ease, making them a cornerstone of modern web development.

## 4) Benefits of using REST APIs

- One of the main benefits of REST APIs is that they are easy to understand and use. The standard HTTP methods and resource representation model make it simple for developers to integrate with REST APIs.
- REST APIs can communicate using any data format. In other words, they can be adapted to almost any application on the web regardless of its format, language or architecture.
- REST APIs are based on standard HTTP operations, and it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" for clarity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.
- With REST, information that is produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

## 5) Challenges of using REST APIs

## We have found the most popular challenges of REST APIs

### 1- **Securing REST API Parameter Combinations**

- What makes REST API testing, so challenging is the large number of parameter combinations that have to be covered. The purpose of API parameters is to pass data values through API endpoints via data requests. Certain REST API parameter combinations can trigger faulty program states that might potentially expose APIs to external attacks or cause crashes.

- One of the best ways to ensure the security of a REST API is to test all of its parameter combinations. However, with each added parameter, the amount of possible combinations increases exponentially. Going through these parameter combinations manually is highly time-consuming and challenging. Therefore, testing approaches that can automatically generate test cases for these parameters are particularly helpful to secure REST APIs, especially in large projects with many dependencies.

### 2-Validating REST APIs Parameters

- Another challenge regarding REST APIs is validating the parameters that are transmitted through API requests. A buggy application, or a malicious attacker, might call the API with parameters that don't fit the expected data types or value ranges. Without careful validation, this can trigger crashes or unexpected program behavior that might lead to security or stability issues.

- Considering how many values most data types allow, it is unthinkable to test all of them manually. Even with automated testing tools, the sheer number of combinations is often too big to cover. Only [white-box testing solutions](https://www.code-intelligence.com/blog/fuzzing-apis) are smart enough to pick values that are known from experience to cause problems. This way they can automatically generate inputs that try to cover all relevant parameter combinations.

### 3- Maintaing Data Formatting

- [In API testing](https://www.code-intelligence.com/rest-api-testing), *data formatting* describes the schema that specifies how data is formatted. Since this schema handles responses and requests of REST APIs, it has to be maintained and updated regularly to ensure that newly added parameters are included in the schema. Automated testing solutions often allow for parsing of the API documentation and generate test cases based on this. If you test your API continuously and somehow documentation and implementation are out of sync, this would be easily recognizable making it easier to overcome the challenges.

### 4- ****Securing API Call Sequences****

- When calling an API, a client application sends multiple requests, which must be called in the correct order. If the requests are handled in the wrong order, the program will return an error. An example of this would be the error that comes up when an API call to delete an object is made before the call to create it.

- Ensuring the correct REST API call sequence is often neglected during REST API testing. Nonetheless, this step is vital for the quality and security of REST APIs, especially in multithreaded programs.

### 5- ****Setting up an Automated REST API Test****

- The initial configuration is the part of automated REST API testing that requires the most manual effort. While it is possible to build a continuous REST API testing cycle with open-source software, experience shows that this is usually vastly time-consuming. Particularly in large projects, I would advise against DIY automation and opt for something out-of-the-box.

- Modern testing platforms, [such as CI Fuzz,](https://www.code-intelligence.com/cli-tool) enable a simplified set-up of automated REST API tests. Usually, such platforms provide instructions that guide users all the way from the local installation to the first automated API test. With a little bit of tuning, testing platforms can then continuously test REST APIs with each pull request.

### 6- ****REST API Error Reporting****

- Conventional [black-box testing](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cyber-security/what-is-penetration-testing/what-is-black-box-testing/#:~:text=Black%20box%20testing%2C%20a%20form,automated%20black%20box%20security%20testing.) tools can't measure test coverage during REST API testing, which greatly reduces the effectiveness of test inputs and the value of test reports. White-box testing approaches enable testers to generate inputs that cover large parts of the tested software while providing detailed error reports and code-coverage visibility. These reports support developers in planning their testing efforts and enable them to provide documentation to their team.
